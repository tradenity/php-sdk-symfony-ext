Welcome to Tradenity Symfony framework SDK extensions.
==========

This extension library facilitates integration between Symphony framework based applications and [PHP SDK](https://github.com/tradenity/php-sdk) for [Tradenity ecommerce API](https://www.tradenity.com).

## Installation

This package is available through Packagist (PHP Package Index), to install it type the following on the command line:

    $ composer install tradenity/symfony-ext

Or, add this line to your application's composer.json:

```ruby
{
'tradenity/symfony-ext':"0.5.0"
}
```

And then execute:

    $ composer install

Dfine the required services:

In `app/config/services.yml`:

```yml

services:
    tradenity.session.service:
        class: Tradenity\SDK\Ext\Symfony\Services\SessionService
        arguments: ['@request_stack']

    app.tradenity_customer_user_provider:
        class: Tradenity\SDK\Ext\Symfony\Auth\CustomerUserProvider
        
```

If you will use the provided authentication support, add this to your security encoders:

```yml

encoders:
    Tradenity\SDK\Ext\Symfony\Auth\CustomerUser:
        algorithm:            bcrypt
        cost:                 10
            
```

Now you can add your credentials and start use the SDK services:

In `app/config/config.yml`:
 
```yml

parameters:
    tradenity_key: sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    stripe_public_key: pk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
